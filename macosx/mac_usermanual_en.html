    <p>Safe Exam Browser – SEB for Mac OS X opens a web browser window without navigation elements and locks the computer into a kiosk mode, which prevents from switching to other applications or quitting SEB untimely. The major  version update <span class="quote">Safe Exam Browser  2.0</span><span class="half_linespace"> enables  secure exams on unmanaged computers like students' own laptops (BYOD) and facilitates the use of SEB in managed environments</span>. Currently SEB integrates with the wide spread learning management systems (LMS) Moodle and ILIAS, although it can easily be connected with most  web-based  e-assessment systems.<br />

    <h4><a name="features" id="features"></a>Features</h4>
    <p>To prevent switching to other applications or interrupting an exam, SEB disables the OS X Dock, the process switcher (cmd-tab/cmd-shift-tab), the Apple Menu and various other items in the menu bar, the <span class="quote">Force Quit</span> window (cmd-opt-esc), normal reboot (ctrl-cmd-eject), normal shutdown (ctrl-opt-cmd-eject), hiding the application, printing and Exposé. Display and system idle sleep is also prevented while SEB is running. It can also be set whether  users can quit SEB and if it is required to enter a quit password to do so.</p>
    <p>Its possible to configure SEB to quit after the exam is submitted without having to enter a quit password by specifying a <span class="quote">quit link</span> and placing this on the summary page displayed by the LMS after submitting the exam.</p>
<p>In the browser window there is no right mouse (or ctrl-) click popup window available, links requesting to be opened in a separate window can be set to be blocked generally, to open in the same  browser window or in a new SEB window. Besides that, the browser is supporting Quicktime, Java and Flash content (as long as the required Flash plugin is installed on the system).  </p>
    <p>SEB detects when it was started in a virtual instead of a native environment and refuses to run. This virtual machine detector hinders manipulating SEB further when used in unmanaged environments.</p>
    <p>SEB for Mac OS X is based on the WebKit browser engine, which is also used by Safari, Apple Mail and many open source browsers  (in contrast to the Mozilla Firefox/XULRunner/Gecko engine used by SEB for Windows). There might be some small differences and issues regarding rendering of web pages in those different browser engines, so you should check all functionality of your quiz in SEB for Mac OS X before using it in exams.  </p>
<p> SEB for Mac OS X can be used together with additional (third party) applications during an exam. You can download and open files linked in your online exam, edit it in a third party application and then upload the results to your online quiz/LMS again. Currently this is only possible when SEB is used in a separate user account managed by OS X parental controls.</p>
<p>From version 2.0, encrypted <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files are used which allow to individually configure SEB per exam.</p>
<p>
Also see the  <a href="../presentations/HowTo_SEB2.0.pdf" target="_blank">how to use SEB 2.0 document</a> explaining the concept behind SEB 2.0 and its new features.</p>
<p><strong><span class="red">Please understand that you also have to configure your exam system correctly to be locked down securely.</span></strong> SEB is generally  locking down exam client computers only, not the exam system or the quiz module of a learning management system. <strong>Check documentation for your exam/learning management system on how to lock it down correctly.</strong></p>
<h4><a name="moodle" id="moodle"></a><strong>Using SEB with Moodle</strong></h4>
<p> SEB support in Moodle has the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Don't display any links during an exam which would allow to navigate to other sections of Moodle or even other websites. This means the course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout, link to the University homepage etc. needs to be disabled/hidden. Only the quiz navigation (to navigate to other questions) and the &quot;Finish attempt...&quot; link  should be visible </li>
  <li>Make sure a quiz can only be taken using Safe Exam Browser, display an error message if trying to open the quiz in another web browser. </li>
  <li>Optionally check if the correct version of SEB and  legitimate SEB settings are used.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two options how to activate SEB support in Moodle. Both achieve the above objectives 1 and 2. Only the second option also ensures objective 3 is met:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enable the &quot;classic&quot;  SEB support in Moodle: <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Safe_exam_browser" target="_blank">How to activate the SEB secure browser mode in a Moodle quiz</a>. Then configure the quiz at <span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Browser security / Require the use of Safe Exam Browser</span>. This option uses only a basic, not very secure check for the used browser. This may be safe enough if students can only access the exam from centrally managed university computers inside a computer lab/exam room. For other scenarios like BYOD you should use the second option.</li>
  <li>Use the <span class="quote"> Browser Exam Key</span> authentication in Moodle for the connecting SEB version and its settings by installing the <a href="https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-quizaccess_safeexambrowser" target="_blank">quiz access rule plugin</a> in Moodle. In addition you will have to copy the Browser Exam Key hash code string into the quiz settings (<span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Allowed browser keys</span>). This key is generated by SEB when you save the settings you intend to use for the exam. As this key includes a hash (checksum) of both the saved exam settings and the code signature of the used SEB version, you may have to generate and copy several Browser Exam Keys into the Moodle quiz settings, for example one for the Windows version of SEB and one for the Mac version.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes hiding course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout etc. doesn't work as expected because <span class="red">some custom Moodle themes don't support the secure browser mode of Moodle correctly, they display links with which students can get out of the quiz during an exam.</span> If this happens only with your customized theme and not the standard Moodle theme, then your theme is not implemented correctly. In that case you should fix the problem in your custom Moodle theme.  You may also create URL filter rules which only allow to access the exam and no other parts of Moodle, but this is not trivial and we cannot provide you with any support on that. </p>
<p>You may find additional information and help in the discussion boards for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/seb/discussion/" target="_blank">SEB</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=737" target="_blank">Moodle</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="download" id="download"></a>Download/Installation</h4>
    <p>You can download the DMG disk image file <a href="../download_en.html#MacOSX">here</a>. If it doesn't get mounted, just double click on the downloaded file. Then  drag the SEB application to the Applications folder (you can drop it on the alias icon in the mounted volume). <strong>Make sure you don't have another SEB version 2.x on your Mac</strong> (as a <span class="path">.seb</span> config file or a <span class="path">seb://</span> link might get opened with the wrong version).<br />
    </p>
    <h4><a name="starting" id="starting"></a>Starting and Quitting SEB</h4>
    <p>When you start SEB, all currently running applications are hidden and all attached screens are covered with a black background. On the main screen SEB opens its web browser window filling the whole screen (the window can be resized and moved nevertheless). Optionally you can use a full screen presentation or customize the relative or absolute width, height and horizontal positioning of the SEB main browser window and separately for secondary browser windows. </p>
    <p>SEB opens the webpage at the preset <span class="quote">Start URL</span>, which might take some seconds. Initially, as long as you don't set another <span class="quote">Start URL</span> (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>), SEB for Mac OS X opens the project web site displaying this documentation.</p>
    <p>SEB can display navigation buttons in the browser window toolbar (if enabled), and if browsing back/forward has been enabled, you can use <span class="quote">cmd-Cursor Left</span> to go back in the browser history and <span class="quote">cmd-Cursor Right</span> to go forward in  history. <span class="quote">Cmd-R</span> reloads the current page.</p>
    <p>To quit SEB (while it's using the default settings), just press <span class="quote">cmd-Q</span> or the red close button in the browser window. Quitting SEB can be switched off or password protected in its settings. When SEB quits, the applications which were visible before starting SEB will get unhidden again.</p>
<h4><a name="configuration" id="configuration"></a>Configuration</h4>
    <p>SEB for Mac OS X has a comfortable  built-in editor for the platform-independent SEB configuration files, which can also set all additional individual settings for the Windows version. Invoke it by selecting <span class="quote">Preferences…</span> in the SafeExamBrowser menu (if visible), by simultaneously pressing the <span class="quote">cmd - ,</span> (comma) keys, or the <span class="quote">F3 and F6</span> keys (on modern Mac keyboards you also have to hold the <span class="quote">fn</span> key). After setting a <span class="quote">SEB administrator password</span>, users have to enter this to display the preferences window. SEB for Mac OS X can also be configured not to display the preferences window at all, this could make sense on exam client computers.</p>
    <p>While the preferences window is displayed, switching to other running (initially hidden) applications is possible and the screen background isn't blacked out. Also the menu bar is displayed, so  SEB menu commands can be used. You can also drag and drop .seb configuration files onto the preferences window or the SEB icon in the OS X dock (not the SEB dock). In the preferences window 9 tabs with grouped settings are available. In the <span class="quote">General</span> pane you'll find  basic settings like the URL which SEB opens and the passwords to enter preferences and to quit SEB. <span class="quote">Config File</span> contains details about encryption of the SEB <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files plus all functions to deal with opening, saving, reverting, duplicating and applying settings. These commands can also be accessed in the <span class="quote">Settings</span> menu  and the popdown menu in the preferences window title bar (clicking on the triangle symbol). <span class="quote">Appearance</span> contains general SEB user interface settings, <span class="quote">Browser</span> all detail settings for the built-in SEB web browser. <span class="quote">Down/Uploads</span> refers to   file downloads and uploads, <span class="quote">Exam</span> handles the connection to  exam systems and exam specific settings. <span class="quote">Application</span> is for handling  permitted and prohibited processes, <span class="quote">Network</span> about the URL filter, certificates and proxies. <span class="quote">Security</span> contains detail settings about how SEB locks down security relevant system features.</p>
    <p><strong>There are two different modes in which you can edit settings: </strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="quote">Edit local client settings</span>: Changes settings of this SEB client. These <span class="quote">local client settings</span> are saved persistently on drive (in the ~Library/Preferences/ directory). When you change a setting option, then  it is immediately saved (this is how preferences in other Mac OS X standard applications work). <br />
      <strong>In the title bar of the Preferences window</strong> <em>'Local Client Settings' </em>is displayed instead of a file name.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Edit a .seb settings file</span>:  When you open a settings file, it is always loaded temporary into memory and will be discarded when you quit SEB. So loading a .seb settings file for editing into the Preferences window (which serves as the configuration editor in SEB for Mac OS X, similar to the SEB Config Tool in SEB for Windows) won't change settings of this SEB client permanently. If you change something, you have to explicitly save the changed settings into the same file  (using the command <span class="quote">Save</span>) or to another file (<span class="quote">Save As</span>…). <br />
      <strong>In the title bar of the Preferences window</strong> the file name of the currently loaded settings file<span class="quote"></span> is displayed, together with an file icon. As usual in OS X document windows, you can cmd-click this icon to show the path where the file is saved (as long as it already was saved on drive, see below).    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can switch from <em>editing local client settings</em> to <em>editing a settings file</em> with the commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="quote">Save As…</span> Saves local client settings into a .seb file and  if answering the following alert 'Edit Saved Settings'? with <span class="quote">Edit File</span> switches from local client settings to the new file.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Edit Duplicate</span>: Switches to editing settings file (with the default file name <span class="path">SebClientSettings.seb</span>), when saving this config file, the file chooser will be displayed to select a destination directory and to change the file name if desired.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can switch from <em>editing a settings file</em> to  <em>local client settings</em> with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="quote">Revert Settings to Local Client Settings</span>: The currently edited settings file is discarded and SEB switches back to editing local client settings.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Use Current Settings to Configure Client</span>: Settings from the .seb file which is currently being edited are used to configure local client settings (overwriting current local client settings) and SEB  switches to editing local client settings.</li>
    </ul>
<p>When closing the Preferences window, SEB asks if edited settings should be saved (if you were editing a .seb settings file, local client settings are autosaved as described above). SEB also asks if those edited settings should be applied. If you answer <span class="quote">Don't Apply</span>, then edited settings are discarded and SEB continues using settings which were in place before opening the Preferences window. If you answer <span class="quote">Apply</span>, then SEB reconfigures and restarts itself using those edited settings, and the web page at <em>Start</em> <em>URL</em> is loaded.</p>
<p>If you apply an opened/edited .seb settings file, then SEB is running in the exam mode, same as if SEB is started opening a .seb config file for starting an exam or if the user loaded a .seb config file for starting an exam from an exam portal page. More information about this you can find in the   <a href="../presentations/HowTo_SEB2.0.pdf" target="_blank">how to use SEB 2.0 document</a> explaining the concept behind SEB 2.0.</p>
<p>Detail description of all parameters in the preferences window panes follows below. You can also use tool tips (move the mouse pointer over a button, text field or other control in the Preferences window) to get a short explanation for the function of the according setting option.</p>
<h4><a name="GeneralPane" id="GeneralPane"></a>Settings in  the General Pane    </h4>
    <div class="image4"><img src="images/SEB_PreferencesGeneral-2.0-en.png" alt="SEB Preferences Window General Pane" width="762" height="532" /></div>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="quote">Start URL</span>: Full URL (starting with http:// or https://) of the page to open when SEB is started.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Paste from saved clipboard</span>: SEB saves the content of the clipboard (if it's a text string) when starting up and before clearing the clipboard. Use this link to paste the saved string to the <span class="quote">Start URL</span> field.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Administrator password</span>: Password required to enter the preferences window. It's recommended to set one!</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Confirm administrator password</span>: Retype the administrator password. As long as it's not matching the administrator password typed in the field above, <span class="quote">Passwords don't match</span> is displayed below and you cannot save the preferences.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Allow user to quit SEB</span>: If selected, Users can quit SEB with <span class="quote">cmd-Q</span> or clicking the main browser window (the one that displays the exam) close button. Otherwise you can use a quit link in your exam system, shutdown or reset the computer or use the <span class="quote">Quit</span> button in this preferences window. In a computer room in a university or school you could for example use some tool to shutdown or reboot all computers after a exam and therefore not allow students to quit SEB themselves at all. </li>
      <li><span class="quote">Ignore exit keys</span> (Win): SEB ignores the exit keys and can only be quit manually by entering the quit password. Exit keys can only be set and used in the Windows version of SEB and are considered deprecated,  the prefered way to secure SEB from being quit is the quit password.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Quit password</span>: This password is prompted when users try to quit SEB with <span class="quote">cmd-Q</span> or the red close button in the browser window. If no quit password is set, then SEB just prompts <span class="quote">Are you sure you want to quit SEB?</span></li>
      <li><span class="quote">Confirm quit password</span>: Retype the quit password. As long as it's not matching the quit password typed in the field above, <span class="quote">Passwords don't match</span> is displayed below and you cannot save the preferences.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">About</span>: Shows a window with copyright information and the version number of the SEB you're running. Click somewhere into the window to close it.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Help-Button &quot;?&quot;</span>: Displays this manual page in a new browser window.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can get out of the preferences windows using one of the three buttons described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="quote">Close window</span> (standard red close button in the windows title bar).</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Restart SEB</span>: Saves preferences, eventually reconfigures and restarts SEB, displaying the webpage at start URL.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Quit</span>: Saves preferences and exits SEB.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also exit SEB while applying changed settings using the item <span class="quote">Apply and Restart SEB</span> in the <span class="quote">Settings</span> menu.</p>

    <p><span class="quote">Local client settings</span> are saved according to Mac OS X standards in the user's <span class="path">Library/Preferences/</span> directory (<span class="path">~/Library/Preferences/</span>, is by default invisible in Finder). Starting SEB version 2.0, it isn't anymore possible to deploy the <span class="path">org.safeexambrowser.Safe-Exam-Browser.plist</span> file from the Preferences folder to other machines (due to stronger, individual encryption per client). Instead, either deploy and open a .seb config file saved with the option 'Use SEB settings file for ... configuring a client'. This requires user interaction, because SEB will show an alert 'Local settings of this SEB client have been reconfigured. Do you want to continue working with SEB now or quit?' and one of the buttons 'Continue' or 'Quit' has to be clicked. As an alternative, you can use the new pre-configuration feature when deploying SEB on managed systems which works similar like in SEB for Windows (and doesn't require user interaction): </p>
    <p>While starting, SEB now checks if there is a configuration file named <span class="path">SebClientSettings.seb</span> in in the Preferences folder (<span class="path">~/Library/Preferences/</span>) and reconfigures itself silently (no user feedback) to the settings in that file, then the file is deleted. This works only if the administrator password in this file matches the one set in the local settings of the SEB client or if there isn't an administrator password set yet in the local settings. This means, if the SEB clients haven't been configured before (because SEB just got installed), you can set an arbitrary administrator password in the  <em>SebClientSettings.seb</em> file. The second time you reconfigure SEB clients with this method, the administrator password in the new <em>SebClientSettings.seb</em> file has to match the one used before, otherwise the client won't be reconfigured. The file can either be unencrypted or encrypted with a password that matches the administrator password set in the local settings of the SEB client (otherwise the password to decrypt the settings file will be prompted).</p>

      <strong>Important: First save your final exam settings in a .seb settings file and then generate and copy the browser exam key to your exam system's quiz settings as the Browser Exam Key changes when you change any setting</strong>. <br />
      Please note that if you want to use the same .seb config file with Windows and Mac clients, you should not alter the file anymore when you're copying the Browser Exam Key hashes to your exam settings in your quiz module. Re-saving it will change the Browser Exam Key of that file also in the SEB version on the other platform. The keys for the Mac and the Windows version will in any case be different, so you have to load the final .seb file into both versions and copy both keys to your quiz settings.      </li>
      <li> <span class="quote">Copy Browser Exam Key to clipboard when quitting SEB</span>: SEB clears the clipboard when quitting, so you should either use SEB to copy the exam key to your quiz settings or this option to find the exam key in the clipboard after quitting SEB.</li>

        Use this option only when running SEB in a user account managed by parental controls, with only SEB and the desired applications allowed. Also you should switch on <span class="quote">Simple Finder</span> and don't give users access to other accounts with administrator rights on that computer (see <a href="#secure_environment">Secure Environment</a>).

With prohibited processes you can prevent some specific background processes and applications from running together with SEB. Use this with care, test if the system continues to run safely when the blacklisted processes are killed by SEB.</p>

        String with the user identifier under which this process is running. If no user is indicated, then the process is killed regardless under which user it's running. Instead of this identifier also the key <em>currentUser</em> can be used.<br />
        Optional</li>

        Indicates whether an application (or process) may be killed in a not-nice way, what may cause data loss if the application had unsaved data in memory or was just writing to a persistent memory/drive. If this application is safe to be killed anytime, then setting this flag to true helps to avoid bothering users: If this flag is set to false and the application is running when SEB is started, then an alert/dialogue window is displayed to ask the user to quit this prohibited application together with other not permitted applications and to restart SEB afterwards (or to let SEB kill the applications risking that there could be data loss).<br />
        Setting this flag to false does not mean that processes (and applications) are not killed: Depending on the platform's capabilities, SEB first tries to terminate prohibited processes and applications nicely or asking the user to do it themselves, if this doesn't work then it kills them strongly anyways (as long as <em>monitor processes</em> is enabled). But enabling <em>Strong kill</em> will speed up this process.<br />

    </ul>
    <p>The table contains  URL filter rules, consisting of a <span class="quote">allow</span> or <span class="quote">block</span> action. The URL filter always first processes rules with the block action, if one matches, then the according http request is discarded. If no block rule matched, then rules with an allow action are processed. If one matches, then the request is loaded. If no allow rule matched, then the request is discarded.<br />
    Discarding a http request means that a link with the URL is not followed and the user is notified with an alert. When content filtering is enabled, an embedded resource with the according URL is not loaded, in this case there's no notification about that, but it is written to the log (log level Warning on Mac). Create a new rule  by clicking the<span class="codetext">'+'</span> button below the table. Remove a rule by selecting it in the table and clicking the <span class="codetext">'-'</span> button.</p>

        </span>      <span class="quote">Format for a filter expression in the non-regex format:</span><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Scheme  is optional, and must be followed by <span class="codetext">'://'</span>.<br />
          </li>
          <li>The host field is required (besides when filtering against a protocol like about:blank or data:), and is either a partial or full hostname or an IP address. It can also contain or be replaced completely with the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span> char, see below for details. The URL filter doesn't resolve hostnames itself, so if you allow everything and only block <span class="codetext">'hostname.com'</span>, then that host could still be reached using its IP address. You should therefore mainly use whitelisting to allow accessing only specific sites during an exam.</li>
          <li>An optional <span class="codetext">'.'</span> (dot) can prefix the host field to disable subdomain matching, see below for details.</li>
          <li>An optional port can come after the host and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">':'</span>. It must be a valid port value from 1 to 65535.</li>
          <li>An optional path can come after the host or after the port and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">'/'</span>. Parts of the path can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
          <li>URL parameters like a query string can be indicated and always have to start with the character <span class="codetext">'?'</span>. Parts of the query can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
          <li>Filtering against a fragment usually doesn't make sense, as the content can be reached by scrolling the loaded page. Allowing specific fragments could force people to use a link to a particular anchor on a page (other links would not work).<br />
            <br />
            <span class="quote">      Examples for filter expressions:</span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com'</strong></span> matches <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.com'</span> and <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.com'</span> (internally processed as a host name search for <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> and a search for <span class="codetext">'*.example.com'</span>)</li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'.www.example.com'</strong></span> matches exactly <span class="codetext">'*://www.example.com'</span>  (no other subdomains)</li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'mail.*'</strong></span> matches all hosts having a subdomain or domain <span class="codetext">'mail'</span>, like  <span class="codetext">'mail.ethz.ch'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.gov.to'</span>, <span class="codetext">'mail.com'</span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*:8088'</strong></span> matches all requests to port 8088</li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com/stuff/*'</strong></span> matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'stuff'</span> as the first segment of the path<span class="codetext"></span></li>
          <li><strong><span class="codetext">'example.com/images/*.png'</span> </strong>matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> as the first segment of the path and <span class="codetext">'.png'</span> as the path extension of an file URL (means it matches all PNG images in the <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> directory or its subdirectories)<span class="codetext"></span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*.net'</strong></span> matches all host with any kind of subdomains in the .net top level domain like <span class="codetext">'example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.net'</span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*/*.net'</strong></span> matches all files with a <span class="codetext">'.net'</span> file extension on any host<br />
            <br />
            You should consider using a regular expression if performing complex filtering (when a simple filter doesn't cover all possible cases how that complex URL could be formatted) or split the expression into several filter rules.  

The order of filter rules is not relevant.<br />

    <ul>
      <li>Here you can choose <span class="quote">SSL server certificates</span> from the keychain. The selected certificates will be included into a <span class="quote">.seb</span> settings file when it is saved and used on the SEB clients which are started up with that <span class="quote">.seb</span> exam configuration. Like this users won't be presented a warning when connecting to  https servers with self-signed certificates and you  don't need to distribute SSL certificates manually to the exam client computers.</li>
      <li>You can also choose <span class="quote">cryptographic identities</span> from the keychain which are suitable for decrypting <span class="quote">.seb</span> files on SEB exam clients (X.509 certificates with RSA public key and associated private key). Those will also be added to the .seb settings file. Use this feature  for creating a .seb file for configuring a client and add the identity or identities you like to use for encrypting .seb files for starting exams later. Thanks to this feature you won't need to export the identities in Keychain Access and install it on your SEB clients manually.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><a name="NetworkPaneProxiesSection" id="NetworkPaneProxiesSection"></a>Proxies Section</h5>
    <p>In this pane you can configure proxy settings for the exam client computers which  override the system's proxy settings on the clients. <strong>Using those SEB proxy settings is not yet functional in SEB 2.0 for Mac</strong>. SEB 2.0.2 for Windows  supports limited individual proxy settings which you can configure here.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="quote">SEB Service policy</span>: The SEB Service is a background process running with elevated privileges (as administrator/Root), which is necessary to block and unblock some system features (in OS X <span class="quote"> Fast User Switching</span>, disabling the Notification Center  while working with third party applications) and killing prohibited system processes when using <span class="quote">monitor processes</span>.  SEB Service is installed automatically with SEB downloaded from <a href="../download_en.html#MacOSX">safeexambrowser.org</a>, but needs to be installed manually when installing SEB from the App Store. You can define the policy that applies when an exam client doesn't have the SEB Service installed:
    </li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="quote">allow to use SEB without service</span>:  SEB  is allowed to run without the SEB Service, it will only be noted in the log that the service was not securing the computer during the exam.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">warn when service is not running</span>: A warning is displayed when the service is not installed/running, but the exam can be started.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">allow to use SEB only with service</span>:  SEB  is only allowed to run when the SEB Service is installed. <br />
          </li>
      </ul>
          <strong>SEB 2.0 for Mac OS X doesn't  use the SEB Service yet.</strong> Currently this setting has an effect in SEB for Windows only.<br />&nbsp;
      <li><span class="quote">Allow SEB to run inside virtual machine</span>: Indicates if SEB is allowed to run in a virtual machine (e.g. for exams in virtual desktop environments) or not (in order to prevent potential manipulations).</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Enable screen capture</span>: Controls OS X screen capture (invoked with cmd-3 and cmd-4), corresponds with Enable Print Screen in Windows. If users have the DropBox client installed and activated to upload screen shots directly to their DropBox, then this will also be stopped when screen capture is disabled.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Allow user switching</span>: Indicates if <em>Fast User Switching</em> is allowed. When using SEB on students' own computers this key should be set to false. Otherwise when the computer is put to sleep and woken up again, in the lock screen &quot;Switch user&quot; is shown and when using a third party application or enabling the menu bar the <em>Fast User Switching</em> option is displayed on the right side of the menu bar.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Disable app switcher when starting</span>: SEB checks for the command key being held down while SEB is starting up. This prevents using the application switcher to mess with SEB's kiosk mode</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Force installation in Applications folder</span>: SEB enforces to be installed in an Applications folder (/Applications or ~/Applications)</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Enable logging</span>: The log can help in debugging SEB (if you send it to the developers) and to find out about possible manipulations. You can save the log to a network drive mounted on all exam client computers, since the log's name is unique and contains the machine's name and IP address. </li>
      <li><span class="quote">Log level</span>: The log level indicates which information gets saved. <strong>Error</strong> includes fatal application and browser level errors, <strong>Warning</strong> are non-fatal but non-expected or security affecting events. <strong>Info</strong> includes most user actions including all browser navigation actions like addresses of opened web pages. <strong>Debug</strong> is reserved for information which is only necessary for in-deep program code debugging. The log will contain the selected log level plus all levels with a lower value, a log with the <strong>Verbose</strong> level contains events of all levels.. Default is Warning (error and warning messages).  <strong>Debug</strong> and <strong>Verbose</strong> are meant for debugging (send such a log file to the SEB developers to find out details about a problem). </li>
      <li><span class="quote">Save log file to</span>: Choose the directory where to save the log to. <!--If you select a path inside the current user's home directory, then the path to the home directory is internally replaced with the according tilde placeholder (~/), so this abreviated relative path will also work on a client computer with another home directory name. -->You could also save the log to a network drive mounted on the exam client computer. </li>
      <li><span class="quote">Use standard directory</span>: The log is saved to the directory <span class="path">~/Library/Logs/Safe Exam Browser/</span> which is also displayed in the Console app log list.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Log file directory Windows</span>: Enter a valid,    Windows-specific formatted path.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Settings for SEB Windows</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="quote">System Lockdown</span>: The <span class="quote">Kiosk mode</span>  settings reflect how the computer is locked down while SEB is running, see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#SecurityPane">Windows manual</a> for details. <span class="quote">Enable WiFi control</span>: Displays a control icon in the SEB task bar allowing to reconnect to Wi-Fi networks used before. In SEB 2.0 for Mac OS X this control doesn't exist yet, you can use <span class="quote">Show menu bar</span> in the <a href="#AppearancePane">Appearance pane</a> instead for a similar functionality.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Registry</span>: Select which options in the Windows Security Screen invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Del should be available while SEB is running (switch user, lock this computer, change a password, start Task Manager, log off, shut down, ease of access). In addition the Registry setting <span class="quote">Enable VMware Client Shade</span> activates the 'Shade' bar at the upper edge of a virtual desktop. If you're not using VMware, this setting doesn't have any effect.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Hooked Keys</span>: Here you can select which special and function keys are blocked or enabled. Note: <span class="quote">Enable Print Screen</span> corresponds with <span class="quote">Enable screen capture</span> in OS X (changing one settings also changes the other). Same as in OS X, if users have the DropBox client installed and activated to upload screen shots directly to their DropBox, then this will also be stopped when Print Screen is disabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><a name="operating_system" id="operating_system"></a>Operating System</h4>
    <p> Mac OS X   10.7 (Lion), OS X 10.8  (Mountain Lion), OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) on 64-bit Intel Macs    </p>
    <h4> <a name="secure_environment" id="secure_environment"></a>Secure Environment for Exams with SEB for Mac OS X</h4>
    <p>As mentioned, it is more secure to use SEB for Mac OS X  in a managed environment, for <strong>using third party applications</strong> it's generally recommended in version 2.0.  When you create a separate user account with the settings described below, you can  achieve a really secure environment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a <span class="quote">Standard</span> or <span class="quote">Managed with Parental Controls</span> user account (<span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Accounts</span>). For running third party applications together with SEB, you have to use an account managed by parental controls.</li>
      <li>You can add SEB to <span class="quote">Login Items</span> in the Account Preferences, then SEB will be started automatically after the exam user logs in.</li>
      <li>In <span class="quote">Login Options</span> you should uncheck the checkbox in front of <span class="quote">Show fast user switching menu as</span>, at least when the examinees have access to other accounts on that computer.</li>
      <li> If you use an account with parental controls and third party applications, you can set (<span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Parental Controls</span>) the option <span class="quote">Simple Finder</span> and <span class="quote">Only allow selected applications</span> with only SEB and the desired third party applications selected and in the <span class="quote">Web </span>tab <span class="quote">Allow access to only these websites</span> the URL to your LMS server.</li>
      <li>In <span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Sharing</span> you should switch off everything, especially <span class="quote">Screen Sharing</span>, <span class="quote">File Sharing</span>, <span class="quote">Remote Login</span>, <span class="quote">Remote Management</span> and <span class="quote">Internet Sharing</span>. Or protect everything with proper passwords and don't give  users administrator rights on that computer.</li>
      <li> Enable <span class="quote">Open Firmware Password</span>: The Open Firmware password is a security feature available on modern Macintosh systems. If you enable the Open Firmware password, the computer will execute a secure boot sequence. Specifically, enabling the Open Firmware password prevents users from starting up the computer from a volume other than the chosen as the startup disk (chosen in the <span class="quote">Startup Disk</span> preference panel within the <span class="quote">System Preferences</span>.) Also, enabling the Open Firmware Password prevents users from booting into single user mode using Command-S key combination at boot time. An administrator can enable the Open Firmware password booting up from the restore partition (hold Cmd-R while powering computer up) and using the Set Firmware Password menu option. In OS X 10.7 you need to use the <span class="quote">Firmware Password Utility</span> application that can be copied from the Mac OS X software installation disc (located at <span class="path">/Applications/Utilities/</span> on the disc, not visible in Finder, use the Terminal).<br />
        The Open Firmware Password will be reset if a user changes the amount of the physical memory in the machine and reboots. Systems which require Open Firmware Password level security need to be protected from users gaining physical access to the internals of the computer.</li>
