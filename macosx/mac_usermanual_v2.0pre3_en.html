    <p><strong>This is a preliminary document for a software version which is currently in development and does not yet contain all features of the final release. Therefore this information is not final and subject to change after new version updates are released.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Various options and features mentioned in this manual are not yet available or disabled in version 2.0pre3 and will be enabled  after extensive testing in upcoming releases. See <a href="mac_release_notes_en.html#releasenotes">release notes</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>Safe Exam Browser – SEB for macOS opens a web browser window without navigation elements and locks the computer into a kiosk mode, which prevents from switching to other applications or quitting SEB untimely. <span class="half_linespace"><span class="quote">Safe Exam Browser 2.0</span> facilitates secure exams on unmanaged computers like students' own laptops</span>. Currently SEB directly supports the wide spread learning management systems (LMS) Moodle and ILIAS, although it can easily be connected with most other web-based online quiz and e-assessment systems.<br />

    <h4><a name="features" id="features"></a>Features</h4>
    <p>SEB disables the macOS Dock, the process switcher (cmd+Tab/cmd+Shift+Tab), menu bar, the <span class="quote">Force Quit</span> window (cmd+opt+esc), normal reboot (ctrl+cmd+eject), normal shutdown (ctrl+opt+cmd+eject), hiding the application, printing and Exposé. Display and system idle sleep is also prevented while SEB is running. It can also be set whether  users can quit SEB and if it is required to enter a quit password to do so.</p>
    <p>Its possible to configure SEB to quit after the exam is submitted without having to enter a quit password by specifying a <span class="quote">quit link</span> and placing this on the summary page displayed by the LMS after submitting the exam.</p>
<p>In the browser window there is no right mouse (or ctrl-) click popup window available, links requesting to be opened in a separate window can be set to be blocked generally, to open in the same  browser window or in a new SEB window. Besides that, the browser is supporting Quicktime, Java and Flash content (as long as the required Flash plugin is installed on the system). Hyperlinks and links embedded in Javascript, in Flash  and other plugins requesting to open in a new window can optionally be  ignored when they link to another host than the one  of the current page. </p>
    <p>SEB detects when it was started in a virtual instead of a native environment and refuses to run. This virtual machine detector hinders manipulating SEB further when used in unmanaged environments.</p>
    <p>SEB MacOSX is based on the WebKit browser engine, which is also used by Safari, Apple Mail and many open source browsers  (in contrast to the Mozilla Firefox/XULRunner/Gecko engine used by SEB for Windows). There are some small differences and issues regarding rendering of web pages and some content in ILIAS and Moodle, so you should check all functionality of your quiz in SEB MacOSX before using it in exams.  </p>
<p> SEB MacOSX can be used together with additional (third party) applications during an exam. You can download and open files linked in your online exam, edit it in a third party application and then upload the results to your online quiz/LMS again. </p>
<p>From version 2.0 SEB uses encrypted <span class="quote">.seb</span> setting files which allow to individually configure SEB per exam.</p>
<p>
Also see the preliminary <a href="../presentations/HowTo_SEB2.0.pdf" target="_blank">how to use SEB 2.0 document</a> explaining the concept behind SEB 2.0 and its new features.<br />
</p>
    <h4><a name="download" id="download"></a>Download/Installation</h4>
    <p>You can download the DMG disk image file <a href="../download_en.html#MacOSX">here</a>. If it doesn't get mounted, just double click on the downloaded file. Then you can drag the SEB application to the Application Folder or any other location on your computer. It is also possible to run SEB directly from the mounted disk image or from a network volume.<br />
    </p>
    <h4><a name="starting" id="starting"></a>Starting and Quitting SEB</h4>
    <p>When you start SEB, all currently running applications are hidden and all attached screens are covered with a black background. On the main screen SEB opens its web browser window filling the whole screen (the window can be resized and moved nevertheless). SEB opens the webpage at the preset Start URL, which might take some seconds. As default, as long as you don't set another <span class="quote">Start URL</span> (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>), SEB MacOSX opens the project web site displaying this documentation. Also a window will be displayed about how to quit SEB  and how to access preferences as long as you don't change some settings in preferences.</p>
    <p>SEB doesn't have any navigation buttons, but if this has been enabled, you can use <span class="quote">cmd+Cursor Left</span> to go back in the browser history and <span class="quote">cmd+Cursor Right</span> to go forward in  history. <span class="quote">Cmd+R</span> reloads the current page.</p>
    <p>To quit SEB (while it's using the default settings), just press <span class="quote">cmd+Q</span> or the red close button in the browser window. Quitting SEB can be switched off or password protected in the Preferences window. When SEB quits, the applications which were visible before starting it will get unhidden again.</p>
<h4><a name="configuration" id="configuration"></a>Configuration</h4>
    <p>SEB MacOSX has a comfortable preferences window build in which can be used for configuring SEB. After you start SEB, press the <span class="quote">cmd + ,</span> (comma) keys, or the <span class="quote">F3 and F6</span> keys (on modern Mac keyboards you also have to hold the <span class="quote">fn</span> key). After setting an administrator password, users have to enter this to display the preferences window. SEB MacOSX can also be configured not to display the preferences window at all, this makes sense on exam client computers.</p>
    <p>In the preferences window you can set the following parameters:</p>
    <h4><a name="GeneralPane" id="GeneralPane"></a>Settings in  the General Pane    </h4>
    <div class="image4"><img src="images/2.0pre3/SEB_PreferencesGeneral-2.0-en.png" width="764" height="511" /></div>
    <ul id="seblist">
      <li><span class="quote">Start URL</span>: Full URL (starting with http:// or https://) of the page to open when SEB is started.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Paste from saved clipboard</span>: SEB saves the content of the clipboard (if it's a text string) when starting up and before clearing the clipboard. Use this link to paste the saved string to the <span class="quote">Start URL</span> field.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Administrator password</span>: Password required to enter the preferences window. It's recommended to set one!</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Confirm administrator password</span>: Retype the administrator password. As long as it's not matching the administrator password typed in the field above, <span class="quote">Passwords don't match</span> is displayed below and you cannot save the preferences.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Allow user to quit SEB</span>: If selected, Users can quit SEB with <span class="quote">cmd+Q</span> or clicking the main browser window (the one that displays the exam) close button. Otherwise you can shutdown or reset the computer or use the <span class="quote">Quit</span> button in this preferences window. In a computer room in a university or school you could for example use some tool to shutdown or reboot all computers after a exam and therefore not allow students to quit SEB themselves at all.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Quit password</span>: This password is prompted when users try to quit SEB with <span class="quote">cmd+Q</span> or the red close button in the browser window. If no quit password is set, then SEB just prompts <span class="quote">Are you sure you want to quit SEB?</span></li>
      <li><span class="quote">Confirm quit password</span>: Retype the quit password. As long as it's not matching the quit password typed in the field above, <span class="quote">Passwords don't match</span> is displayed below and you cannot save the preferences.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">About</span>: Shows a window with copyright information and the version number of the SEB you're running. Click somewhere into the window to close it.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Help-Button &quot;?&quot;</span>: Displays this manual page in the browser window. Preferences stay open, if they get hidden behind the browser window, you can access them by pressing the same keys as mentioned before.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can get out of the preferences windows using one of the three buttons below:</p>
    <ul id="seblist">
      <li><span class="quote">Close window</span> (standard control in the windows title bar): Accepts preferences and closes window. If you changed start URL, SEB will be restarted to display the new page.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Restart SEB</span>: Saves preferences and restarts SEB, displaying the webpage at start URL.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Quit</span>: Saves preferences and exits SEB.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><a name="ConfigFilePane" id="ConfigFilePane"></a>Settings in the Config File Pane</h4>
    <p>File handling buttons like open, save and revert are not yet final because the settings file handling is not yet final. </p>

    </ul>
    <ul id="seblist">
      <li><span class="quote">Use SEB settings file for ... configuring a client</span>: A SEB settings file saved with this option can be used to change the local settings of a SEB client. Encrypt it with the same password which is set as administrator password on the SEB client (or none if there is no administrator password set on the SEB client yet).</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Allow to open preferences window on client</span>: Usually you should disable the preference window on exam clients besides for debugging purposes. </li>
      <li><span class="quote">Choose identity to be used for encrypting SEB settings file ...</span> In this popup menu  all identities (X.509 certificates with RSA public key and associated private key) in your default keychain are listed, which can be used for encrypting and decrypting. Export the chosen identity (in Keychain Access utility) and install it on your SEB clients.<br />
      </li>
      <li><span class="quote">Settings password</span>: Password to decrypt the settings file, if one is set then it will be prompted when SEB reads the settings.</li>

      <li><span class="quote">Default settings</span>: After the user confirms, settings are reset to the default settings.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Revert to last opened</span>: After the user confirms, settings are reverted to the last ones loaded. Last loaded settings means either by starting SEB or opening a downloaded .seb settings file either in Finder, in another browser or with the <span class="quote">Open Settings</span> button.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Open settings... </span>Lets you choose a .seb settings file which will be loaded into memory, so you can edit the settings.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Save settings as...</span> Lets you choose a file name and location for the SEB settings file. You have to either enter a password or choose a cryptographic identity with which the SEB settings file will be encrypted. Use the saved encrypted settings file  to either start the exam in SEB or to  change the local settings of a SEB client, depending on the <span class="quote">Use SEB settings file for ...</span> option.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>SEB preferences are saved according to macOS standards in the user's <span class="path">Library/Preferences/</span> directory (<span class="path">~/Library/Preferences/</span>, is by default invisible in Finder). The file named <span class="path">org.safeexambrowser.Safe-Exam-Browser.plist</span> is generated after you start SEB the first time, open preferences and save them. In SEB version 2.0pre3 you can still directly deploy this file to the user's <span class="path">Library/Preferences/</span> directories on other computers (for example in a computer room in a university or school) to get them opening the same Start URL and using the same passwords. Even though the preferences file is    encrypted, you should either prevent examinees  from accessing this file by not giving them administrator rights in macOS and using a managed account (see below for a secure environment). In other environments (like on unmanaged student computers, BYOD) don't consider the local SEB configuration being safe. Instead configure your SEB exam clients to display an exam portal page (while displaying this portal page SEB doesn't have to run in a secure mode) and place there links to .seb files <span class="quote">for starting an exam. </span>Like this you can configure SEB securely and individually for each exam. <br />

      <strong>Important: First save your final exam settings in a .seb settings file and then generate and copy the browser exam key to your exam system's quiz settings as the Browser Exam Key changes when you change any setting</strong>. <br />
      Please note that if you want to use the same .seb file with Windows and Mac clients, you should not alter the file anymore when you're copying the Browser Exam Key hashes to your exam settings in your quiz module. Re-saving it (especially in the Windows version) will change the Browser Exam Key of that file also in the SEB version on the other platform.

<h5>Permitted Processes Section</h5>
<p>Third party applications and processes which are permitted to run during an exam. Permitted applications show up in the application chooser, they can be used during an exam in addition to the SEB browser.

        Use this option only when running SEB in a user account managed by parental controls, with only SEB and the desired applications allowed. Also you should switch on <span class="quote">Simple Finder</span> and don't give users access to other accounts with administrator rights on that computer (see <a href="#secure_environment">Secure Environment</a>). <strong>The final version of SEB for macOS 2.0 will allow to use third party applications without a separate managed user account.</strong><br />
      </li>
      <li>        <span class="quote">Allow Flash to switch to full screen mode</span>: Playing videos with Flash in full screen mode is a security problem. That's why it is strongly recommended to use HTML5 video (there full screen mode is no problem) instead of Flash whenever possible. Depending on the Flash video player and the Mac used, it can be difficult to switch back from full screen mode (best is to use the <span class="quote">esc</span> key), so if you don't need full screen mode, don't enable it here.

      <li><span class="quote">Executable</span>: Process name, usually the file name of the executable.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Path</span>: Filesystem path (formatted system specific) to the process executable's directory (excluding the file name, see field name). If the path is not given or relative, then SEB searches the current and system provided paths for applications.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Arguments</span> to append to the path+name of the application/process. You can choose if an argument is <span class="quote">active</span> or not (for testing). You can add and remove arguments using the <span class="quote">+/-</span> buttons.</li>

      <li><span class="quote">Identifier:</span> String of the process identifier in reverse domain notation (Mac) or the string or substring of the main window title of a process which doesn't have a MainWindow handle (Win), this is usually the case with Java applications (use for example &quot;OpenOffice&quot; for OpenOffice Calc).  </li>
      <li><span class="quote">Autohide</span>: Hide the process if it tries to display some window/alert, that means it is only allowed to run in background.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Allow user to select location of application</span>: The user is presented a window allowing to choose the third party application if it cannot be found at the paths specified (instead of just displaying an error message). Only applications matching the other criteria specified (like executable, identifier, signature) are accepted.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Code Signatures</span>: Displays detail information about the code signatures which allow to undoubtedly identify the process or application. To cover different versions of a process/application, multiple signatures can be added. This isn't necessary if the processes/applications are signed with a trusted signature (on macOS by Apple), because the signature identifies an application independently of the program version. Also you can generate code signatures here.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Prohibited Processes Section</h5>

    <p>List of processes which are prohibited to run during an exam (they are on the blacklist) when <span class="quote">monitor processes</span> is enabled. This blacklist of processes makes sense because SEB on both platforms usually allows to run system processes (SEB MacOSX allows all processes and applications signed by Apple to run), but some of them might not be wanted during an exam. With prohibited processes you can prevent some specific background processes and applications from running together with SEB. Use this with care, test if the system continues to run safely when the blacklisted processes are killed by SEB.</p>

      <li><span class="quote">Executable</span>: Process name, usually the file name of the executable.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Description</span>: Optional, should explain what kind of process this is, because this might not be obvious only from the executable's name.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">OS</span>: Indicates on which operating system SEB should watch for the prohibited process  (currently two choices: macOS and Windows).</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Identifier:</span> String of the process identifier in reverse domain notation (Mac) or the string or substring of the main window title of a process which doesn't have a MainWindow handle (Win), this is usually the case with Java applications (use for example &quot;OpenOffice&quot; for OpenOffice Calc). </li>
      <li><span class="quote">User</span><br />
        String with the user identifier under which this process is running. If no user is indicated, then the process is killed regardless under which user it's running. Instead of this identifier also the key <em>currentUser</em> can be used.<br />
        Optional</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Current user</span><br />
        Boolean indicating that the prohibited process has to run under the currently logged in user (not system users). Use it instead of indicating the user identifier (<em>user</em> key).<br />
        Optional</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Strong kill</span><br />
        Boolean indicating whether an application (or process) may be killed in a not-nice way, what may cause data loss if the application had unsaved data in memory or was just writing to a persistent memory/drive. If this application is safe to be killed anytime, then setting this flag to true helps to avoid bothering users: If this flag is set to false and the application is running when SEB is started, then an alert/dialogue window is displayed to ask the user to quit this prohibited application together with other not permitted applications and to restart SEB afterwards (or to let SEB kill the applications risking that there could be data loss).<br />
        Setting this flag to false does not mean that processes (and applications) are not killed: Depending on the platform's capabilities, SEB first tries to terminate prohibited processes and applications nicely or asking the user to do it themselves, if this doesn't work then it kills them strongly anyways (as long as <em>monitor processes</em> is enabled). But enabling <em>Strong kill</em> will speed up this process.<br />
        This flag should not be set for macOS applications which allow to be terminated nicely (they are anyways automatically terminated, without asking the user).</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Code Signatures</span>: Displays detail information about the code signatures which allow to undoubtedly identify the process or application. To cover different versions of a process binary/application, multiple signatures can be added. This isn't necessary if the process binaries/applications are signed with a trusted signature (on macOS by Apple), because the signature identifies an application independently of the program version. Also you can generate code signatures here.</li>

      </li>
      <li> <span class="quote">Filter also embedded content</span>: If selected, also all embedded ressources will be filtered using the filter set.    Note that there can be hundreds of resources such as images and other media per page, so filtering all content may slow down page loading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The table contains  URL filter rules, consisting of one or several actions, displayed as a two level hierarchical list. The rules and the actions inside the rule sets can be rearranged by drag and drop. Create a new rule or a new action by choosing the appropriate type from the popup window on the <span class="codetext">'+'</span> button below the table. Remove an action or rule by selecting it in the table and clicking the <span class="codetext">'-'</span> button.</p>
    <p><strong>Rules (first level rows, can be expanded or collapsed)</strong></p>
    <ul id="seblist">
      <li><span class="quote">Active</span>:
        Indicates if the rule is active.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Expression</span>:
        Text field containing a description of the rule set. This is only displayed in the SEB configuration tool, preferences window and in logs. It should explain what kind of rule this is. Before a description is entered,  a generic &quot;description&quot;/name like &quot;Rule 1&quot;, &quot;Rule 2&quot; etc. is generated.</li>

    <ul id="seblist">
      <li><span class="quote">Active</span>: Indicates if the action is active.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Regex</span>:
        Indicates if the action rule is a regular expression. <br />
        If <em>Regex</em> is not checked, then the rule can be formatted using the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span>, which stands for an arbitrary string of any length.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Action</span> to process if the corresponding expression matches. The URL filter processes the actions and expressions inside each rule one by one. If the URL doesn't match one expression, then the next expression is processed. The actions described below are used to decide what to do if the URL matches the expression.<br />
        <br />
        Possible actions:
<ul id="seblist">
          <li><span class="quote">block</span><br />
            If the URL matches the expression, then it is rejected and processing of following actions inside this rule and processing of rules following the current one is stopped.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">allow</span><br />
            If the URL matches the expression, then it is accepted and processing of following actions inside this rule and processing of rules following the current one is stopped.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">skip</span><br />
            If the URL matches the expression, then processing of the remaining actions inside this rule is stopped and the URL filter continues processing the next rule following the current one.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">and</span><br />
            If the URL matches the expression, then the URL filter continues to process the next action inside this rule. If the URL doesn't match the expression, then the URL filter skips the remaining actions in this rule and continues to process the next rule. Like this you can realize a logical AND dependency of two or more expressions.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">or</span><br />
            If the URL matches the expression, then the URL filter executes the next action inside this rule which is not another <span class="quote">or</span> action (the expression of that non-or action following the or-action is not evaluated, the action is processed regardless of that expression, because the expression of the preceding or-action already matched) If the URL doesn't match the expression, then the next action is processed. Like this you can realize a logical OR dependency of two or more expressions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
      If the URL filter reaches the end of the last rule (means there was no matching block or allow expression found), then the URL is discarded. If you want the URL to be accepted if no matching block (or allow) expression was found, then add an <span class="codetext">'allow *'</span> action/expression as the last rule.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Expression</span>:
        A Text field which contains  the filtering expression or pattern, either in a regular expression (Regex) format or a simpler filter expression containing the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. A filter expression can filter against all elements of a URL/URI according to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC 3986</a>: <span class="codetext"><br />

          </li>
          <li>The host field is required, and is either a partial or full hostname or an IP address. It can also contain or be replaced completely with the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span> char, see below for details. The URL filter doesn't resolve hostnames itself, so if you allow everything and only block <span class="codetext">'hostname.com'</span>, then that host could still be reached using its IP address. You should therefore mainly use whitelisting to allow accessing only specific sites during an exam.</li>
          <li>An optional <span class="codetext">'.'</span> (dot) can prefix the host field to disable subdomain matching, see below for details.</li>
          <li>An optional port can come after the host and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">':'</span>. It must be a valid port value from 1 to 65535.</li>
          <li>An optional path can come after the host or after the port and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">'/'</span>. Parts of the path can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
          <li>URL parameters like a query string can be indicated and always have to start with the character <span class="codetext">'?'</span>. Parts of the query can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.<br />

            <span class="quote">      Examples for filter expressions:</span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com'</strong></span> matches <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.com'</span> and <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.com'</span> (internally processed as a host name search for <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> and a search for <span class="codetext">'*.example.com'</span>)</li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'.www.example.com'</strong></span> matches exactly <span class="codetext">'*://www.example.com'</span>  (no other subdomains)</li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'mail.*'</strong></span> matches all hosts having a subdomain or domain <span class="codetext">'mail'</span>, like  <span class="codetext">'mail.ethz.ch'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.gov.to'</span>, <span class="codetext">'mail.com'</span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*:8088'</strong></span> matches all requests to port 8088</li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com/stuff/*'</strong></span> matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'stuff'</span> as the first segment of the path<span class="codetext"></span></li>
          <li><strong><span class="codetext">'example.com/images/*.png'</span> </strong>matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> as the first segment of the path and <span class="codetext">'.png'</span> as the path extension of an file URL (means it matches all PNG images in the <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> directory or its subdirectories)<span class="codetext"></span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*.net'</strong></span> matches all host with any kind of subdomains in the .net top level domain like <span class="codetext">'example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.net'</span></li>
          <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*/*.net'</strong></span> matches all files with a <span class="codetext">'.net'</span> file extension on any host<br />
            <br />
            You should consider using a regular expression when performing complex filtering (if a simple filter doesn't cover all possible cases how that complex URL could be formatted) or split the expression and combine the expression parts using the <em>and</em> action. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Don't forget that the order of the filter actions and rule sets is very much relevant.</strong> If you would put rule 2 first in the example above, then .seb files would also be allowed from the host <span class="codetext">'maps.google.*'</span>.</li>

    <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Here you can choose <span class="quote">SSL server certificates</span> from the keychain. The selected certificates will be included into a <span class="quote">.seb</span> settings file when it is saved and used on the SEB clients which are started up with that <span class="quote">.seb</span> exam configuration. Like this users won't be presented a warning when connecting to  https servers with self-signed certificates and you  don't need to distribute SSL certificates manually to the exam client computers.</li>
      <li>You can also choose <span class="quote">cryptographic identities</span> from the keychain which are suitable for decrypting <span class="quote">.seb</span> files on SEB exam clients (X.509 certificates with RSA public key and associated private key). Those will also be added to the .seb settings file. Use this feature  for creating a .seb file for configuring a client and add the identity or identities you like to use for encrypting .seb files for starting exams later. Thanks to this feature you won't need to export the identities in Keychain Access and install it on your SEB clients manually.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Proxies Section</h5>
    <p>In this pane you can configure proxy settings for the exam client computers which  override the system's proxy settings on the clients. Using those SEB proxy settings is not yet functional in SEB 2.0 for Mac, it will be available in SEB 2.1. </p>

    <ul id="seblist">
      <li><span class="quote">SEB Service policy</span>: The SEB Service is a background process running with elevated privileges (as Root), which is necessary to block and unblock some system features (like macOS screen capture, <em>Fast User Switching</em>, disabling the Notification Center  in OS X 10.8 and newer while working with third party applications) and killing prohibited system processes when using <em>monitor processes</em>.  SEB Service is installed automatically with SEB downloaded from <a href="../download_en.html#MacOSX">safeexambrowser.org</a>, but needs to be installed manually when installing SEB from the App Store. You can define the policy that applies when an exam client doesn't have the SEB Service installed:
    </li>
        <ul id="seblist">
          <li><span class="quote">allow to use SEB without service</span>:  SEB  is allowed to run without the SEB Service, it will only be noted in the log that the service was not securing the computer during the exam.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">warn when service is not running</span>: A warning is displayed when the service is not installed/running, but the exam can be started.</li>
          <li><span class="quote">allow to use SEB only with service</span>:  SEB  is only allowed to run when the SEB Service is installed. <br />
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><span class="quote">Allow SEB to run inside virtual machine</span>: Indicates if SEB is allowed to run in a virtual machine (e.g. for exams in virtual desktop environments) or not (in order to prevent potential manipulations).</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Allow user switching</span>: Indicates if <em>Fast User Switching</em> is allowed. When using SEB on students' own computers this key should be set to false. Otherwise when the computer is put to sleep and woken up again, in the lock screen &quot;Switch user&quot; is shown and when using a third party application or enabling the menu bar the <em>Fast User Switching</em> option is displayed on the right side of the menu bar.</li>
      <li><span class="quote">Enable logging</span>: The log can help in debugging SEB (if you send it to the developers) and to find out about possible manipulations. You can save the log to a network drive mounted on all exam client computers, since the log's name is unique and contains the machine's name and IP address.    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><a name="operating_system" id="operating_system"></a>Operating System</h4>
    <p> OS X 10.7 (Lion), OS X 10.8  (Mountain Lion) and OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) on 64-bit Intel Macs    </p>
    <h4> <a name="secure_environment" id="secure_environment"></a>Secure Environment for Exams with SEB MacOSX</h4>
    <p>As mentioned, it is more secure to use SEB MacOSX  in a managed environment, for <strong>using third party applications</strong> it's generally recommended in version 2.0pre3.  When you create a separate user account with the settings described below, you can  achieve a really secure environment.</p>
    <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Create a <span class="quote">Standard</span> or <span class="quote">Managed with Parental Controls</span> user account (<span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Accounts</span>). For running third party applications together with SEB, you have to use an account managed by parental controls.</li>
      <li>You can add SEB to <span class="quote">Login Items</span> in the Account Preferences, then SEB will be started automatically after the exam user logs in.</li>
      <li>In <span class="quote">Login Options</span> you should uncheck the checkbox in front of <span class="quote">Show fast user switching menu as</span>, at least when the examinees have access to other accounts on that computer.</li>
      <li> If you use an account with parental controls and third party applications, you can set (<span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Parental Controls</span>) the option <span class="quote">Simple Finder</span> and <span class="quote">Only allow selected applications</span> with only SEB and the desired third party applications selected and in the <span class="quote">Web </span>tab <span class="quote">Allow access to only these websites</span> the URL to your LMS server.</li>
      <li>In <span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Sharing</span> you should switch off everything, especially <span class="quote">Screen Sharing</span>, <span class="quote">File Sharing</span>, <span class="quote">Remote Login</span>, <span class="quote">Remote Management</span> and <span class="quote">Internet Sharing</span>. Or protect everything with proper passwords and don't give  users administrator rights on that computer.</li>
      <li> Enable <span class="quote">Open Firmware Password</span>: The Open Firmware password is a security feature available on modern Macintosh systems. If you enable the Open Firmware password, the computer will execute a secure boot sequence. Specifically, enabling the Open Firmware password prevents users from starting up the computer from a volume other than the chosen as the startup disk (chosen in the <span class="quote">Startup Disk</span> preference panel within the <span class="quote">System Preferences</span>.) Also, enabling the Open Firmware Password prevents users from booting into single user mode using Command-S key combination at boot time. An administrator can enable the Open Firmware password using the <span class="quote">Firmware Password Utility</span> application that can be copied from the macOS software installation disc (located at <span class="path">/Applications/Utilities/</span> on the disc, not visible in Finder, use the Terminal). In OS X 10.8 you need to boot up from the restore partition and use the Set Firmware Password menu option.<br />
        The Open Firmware Password will be reset if a user changes the amount of the physical memory in the machine and reboots. Systems which require Open Firmware Password level security need to be protected from users gaining physical access to the internals of the computer.</li>
